<h1>About Cabot Connects</h1>

<p class="lead">For more than eight years, Cabot Connects has matched adult volunteers with young people (ages 9-17) to promote caring and supportive relationships that improve outcomes for youth and the community.</p>

<div class="text-left">
    <p>Cabot Connects is a tremendous success in many ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>More than 30 adults are matched with youth in our community.  Nearly one-quarter (24%) of eligible youth in Cabot have a mentor.</li>
        <li>The Cabot Connects Mentor Program is greatly increasing the social competence and confidence of our youth, a vital factor to successful youth development, and has provided community members with a meaningful way to make a difference in their community.</li>
        <li>Cabot Connects is the only year-round program that continues during the summer months and vacations, when youth often need additional support.</li>
        <li>Cabot Connects has set a new precedent for collaboration in the community-engaging volunteers, advisory board members, businesses, organizations and institutions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>While our programmatic efforts are focused on youth and families in Cabot, our coordinator serves as a resource to colleagues in the state so that youth beyond Cabot might also benefit from mentoring.  She is also a member of the Central VT Mentoring Coalition and the Leadership Council and Board of Directors of the Mobius Statewide Mentoring Organization.</p>
