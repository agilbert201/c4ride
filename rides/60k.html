      <h3>The Rugged 60</h3>
      <p class="lead">
      Multiple ridges, stunning views, beautiful farms, class 4 adventures and more. This ride has pretty much everything and anything. It will challenge but not beat you, reward but not haunt. Lots of climbing, but some great descents. Well okay maybe we shouldn't say Last Road is "great" but you will remember it. Promise. Hit all the highlight ridges of Cabot including Cabot Plains, Danville Hill, Minister Brook and Houston Hill. You are gonna burn some calories for sure but you will be pummeled by the scenery and adventure even more.

      <p>While this ride is a mix of mostly paved and well maintained dirt roads, there are some short more rustic sections over class 4 roads and paths. This, together with the amount of climbing, much of it on dirt, suggest something a little more rugged and comfortable than your typical 11lb road bike with an 11/54 setup. If you get the drift. If you don't you are probably fine. I.e. you will be on a hybrid, cross or mountain bike anyway. All riders should be prepared for a slightly more elevated physical challenge and allow 3-5 hours depending on pace, fitness and personal choice.</p>
