      <h3>The Warped 100</h3>
      {% include allRides.html %}
      <p class="lead">This 100K ride is a challenging and classic adventure ride, that combines some of the best ridges and climbs of Cabot along with a tour of a special set of roads, forest and ridge line in nearby Danville and Peacham. The experience is guaranteed to reward. But it will extract a price as well. Not for the faint of heart, but worth all the effort. Any ride that is marked by names like "GreenBank Hollow", "Boney Woods Rd", and "Little Scotland" is bound to deliver. And this ride does. Don't believe us, just ask Thaddeus Stevens.
      </p>
      <p>Although this ride is 100K in length, you should treat it and prepare for it much like a classic 100 mile road century. The combination of mostly dirt roads, plus constant up and down of the rolling terrain will take a toll. If you believe MapMyRide you can expect over 7K total elevation gain. Even advanced and highly fit riders would be challenged to best this course in under 5 hours. And this isn't a race. It's an adventure. Plan at least 6, allow 7 or 8.</p>
      <p>Cross, hybrid or mountain bike highly recommended. It is possible on a road bike, but not likely to be comfortable. If riding a road bike we advise no less than a 25cm tire width. While there are no extended overly technical sections, there are a few places where many riders may opt to get off and walk a short distance. There is no shame in this, it's smart.</p>
      <p>Note this ride will also have a mandatory cut off time through the aid station in Peacham. The time and exact location is TBD. Please stay tuned here for more information.</p>
