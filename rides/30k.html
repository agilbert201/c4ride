      <h3>The Sturdy 30</h3>
      {% include allRides.html %}
      <p class="lead">Explore the beauty and fun of Cabot Plains! You might even see snow on Mt Washington. The bad news is you get to climb right from the start. And it's the real deal. Eh, kinda of smacks you in the face actually. But the good news is once you are up there, it is time to take in some truly beautiful and unique views. The Whites and the Greens from one vantage point. Not sure where else you can do that actually. Then you explore the Bailey Hazen, Urban Road, bomb down Danville Hill and get a great closer with Houston Hill and Churchill. This is an AWESOME ride.

      <p>Like the 10K this ride can be done on nearly any type of bike. It is a mix of paved and well maintained dirt roads. There is one significant climb right at the start, plus another up Houston Hill. Again, it isn't a cupcake. It is Vermont. But again, you will do great. We know it. And the down hill back to town center is a hoot. Just please be careful.</p>
