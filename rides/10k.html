      <h3>The Family 10K</h3>
      {% include allRides.html %}
      <p class="lead">This family friendly run, walk, ride offers a lot of adventure and some of the best country views in Cabot. Hold onto your heart as you hit the tree line of Churchill and overlook the Winooski valley. It always delivers! Always.
      </p>
      <p>As a ride this can be done on nearly any type of bike. It is about 1/3 paved and the rest well maintained dirt roads. There is one significant climb that will dispel any notion of it being a cupcake. It is Vermont after all. But you will do great. We know it. And after the wonderful farms and views along the top, you get rewarded with the down hill back to town center.</p>
